# what is PrintHen?
PrintHen is a community driven solution for shared printing needs for startups with shared office space. The idea is simple. Print documents via your office email. It comes with out of the box setup tools. it uses NLP features of [wit.ai](wit.ai) that enables us to send mails in natural language.


## How it works?

PrintHen is targeted towards startups that use shared office spaces. Just assume there are three group of people using the same office space and there is only one printer. Now all the computers need to be connected to the printer in order for the printer to be used. Worse, each computer needs specific drivers for printing to work correctly. All these are a headache to the system admin(if there exists one).

PrintHen solves this problem. The system admin(or any guy with basic knowledge like accessing a webpage) needs to setup printHen once and then any number of users may send mail to a specified email ID(configured beforehand), in natural language, and printHen will print it for you. You dont even need to be in the network or even in the premises where the printer is located. You can just mail it from your home and then take the printouts when u find time to access the printer.
